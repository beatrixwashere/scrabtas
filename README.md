### /tas guide

the `/tas` folder currently contains four different folders:

`/100%`, which contains the movie files used for completing all of the game

`/any%`, which contains the movie files used for beating wf

`/ll1-poet`, which contains the movie files used for beating ll1

`/extras`, which contains movie files that aren't used in any playthroughs yet

`/encodes`, which contains video encodes for watching tases

`/archive`, which contains movie files that are outdated

movie files are split into segments, usually stopping when entering a new room, completing a boss phase, exiting the main menu, etc

movie files have a certain naming format, which is `#_(x,y)_[info].ltm]`

`#` is the order of the segment

`(x,y)` is the coordinates of the room in the segment, or (start) if in the menu and (skrine) if in the skrine room

`[info]` is any other info about the file

in playthrough folders like `/any%`, there are two more folders in addition to all the regular segments:

`/resync`, which contains movie files that are currently being resynced

`/ionly`, which contains movie files with only the input corresponding to the segment, making it easier to copy inputs
