# scrabtasle
github repo for tasing scrabdackle, including movie files, encodes, and other resources

--general file info--

`README.md` is the text file that you're reading right now, containing info for navigating the repo

`/tas` is a folder containing libtas movie files and encodes for each segment

--/tas guide--

the `/tas` folder currently contains four different folders:

`/any%`, which contains the movie files used for beating wf

`/ll1`, which contains the movie files used for beating ll1

`/extras`, which contains movie files that aren't used in any playthroughs yet

`/encodes`, which contains video encodes for watching tases

`/archive`, which contains movie files that are outdated

movie files are split into segments, usually stopping when entering a new room, completing a boss phase, exiting the main menu, etc

movie files have a certain naming format, which is `#_[start/game]_(x,y)_[info].ltm]`

`#` is the order of the segment

`[start/game]` is either `start` or `game`, with `start` being the main menu and `game` being gameplay

`(x,y)` is the coordinates of the room in the segment (only used for game files)

`[info]` is any other info about the file

in playthrough folders like `/ll1-poet`, there are two more folders in addition to all the regular segments:

`/resync`, which contains movie files that are currently being resynced

`/ionly`, which contains movie files with only the input corresponding to the segment, making it easier to copy inputs

--extra notes--

i'll try to add info about each file in the wiki section later on

i hope you enjoy scrabtasing!
